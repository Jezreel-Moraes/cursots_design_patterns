##Creational:

   - Singleton:

	Create a unic instance of an class. 
	(A singleton class shouldnâ€™t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost).
	It must have global access.
	
   - Prototype:

	Create an instance of an class, and save it in an "cache", so you can copy this instance
	as you wish *(warning with shalow copy or deep copy):
	It cost less then create a new instance of a class.

   - Builder:

   An class with functions that return an instanceated object with some especific properties
   already setted, for any case... Is more easy to create some default objects, and create new
   objects with variated internal values...

   - Factory:
